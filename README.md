An R script called run_analysis.R:  This script will calculate means per activity, per subject of the mean and Standard deviation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1]. The required dataset can be downloaded [here.]( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

2. A Code Book called CodeBook.md: This describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called

3. A Readme file called Readme.md (you are here)

### Once executed, the resulting dataset maybe found at . /tidy_data.txt
