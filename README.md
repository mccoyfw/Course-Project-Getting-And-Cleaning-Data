# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Module 3 of the Cousera Data Scientist Specialization
In this project you will find the following items:
1.	An R script called run_analysis.R:  This script will calculate means per activity, per subject of the mean and Standard deviation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1]. The required dataset can be downloaded [here.]( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2.	A Code Book called CodeBook.md: This describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called
3.	A Readme file called Readme.md (you are here)
### Once executed, the resulting dataset maybe found at . /tidy_data.txt
For more details, please refer to the CookBook.md
